# DirectoryTraversalFile
It is the function that statistcs the number of lines of code which files discovered via cfg.
There are two ways to display the result, and it always show them(uh...):
  1.showing all of lines containing blank line, lines such as contain symbol "//" or "/*...*/".Oh, there is a bug that if you annotate a line by using symbols that do not contain the above two, it will consider that the line is valid.
  2.what shows is not containing blank lines and annotating-line.
This is my first project which submits to github.
